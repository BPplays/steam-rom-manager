# Notes
To update all the config presets at once:

1) Make a modifier in `src/renderer/modifiers/config-presets.modifier.ts` to make the desired change to the preset files
2) Commit changes.
2) Add the current app version and the commit hash for the last release (or any commit before presets change) to `files/presetsHashes.json`
3) Run `npm run update-files` and ensure the new presets validate (validation comes from the user-configuration schema), if not `git stash; git stash drop;`.
4) Commit changes and `git push`

# Fixes
